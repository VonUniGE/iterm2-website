3.4.5

New Features:
- Add preference to allow/disallow apps changing
  the function of the option keys with a control
  sequence.
- Add a menu item to pop the current session into
  a new window.
- The git status bar now indicates the repo state
  (merging, reverting, cherrypicking, bisecting,
  rebasing, or applying).
- When you right click on a hex color like #ffeedd
  show a preview of the color in sRGB in the
  context menu.
- Add a new type of trigger to highlight the whole
  line. This is useful because matching .*foo.* is
  very slow. With this trigger you can simply
  match foo and the whole line changes color.

Improvements
- The git status bar component no longer shells
  out to the system git. It uses libgit2 instead
  (nicely named!) and should be faster and more
  reliable now.
- When known, the current git branch is used as a
  search feature in Open Quickly.
- Don't show a line between the titlebar and
  tabbar in Big Sur.
- Increase max allowed blur on macOS 10.14.
- When you move a window to a different screen by
  selecting the Move To Screen menu item, it will
  lose its affinity for the window assigned to it
  in Prefs > Profiles > Window and stay where it
  was put when screens are added or removed.
- Buttons in modal alerts now accept cmd+letter
  shortcuts.
- Ignore dynamic profiles whose filename ends in a
  tilde.
- Reset terminal when relaunching a session (e.g.,
  paste bracketing and mouse reporting).
- The composer window now uses the terminal's
  font.
- Scrolling with the trackpad should be more
  responsive now.
- Change how text is drawn when not using GPU
  renderer to avoid artifacts.
- When doing selection respecting soft boundaries,
  treat a backslash in the last column as a
  continuation mark and don't include it.
- By default, save terminal contents to history
  when there is a scrolling region that touches
  the top of the screen.
- Newly saved window arrangements will restore to
  the right size when scroller style changes after
  they were created (unless there are side-by-side
  split panes).
- Treat soft hyphens as unicode punctuation in
  Advanced Paste.

  titlebar didn't maximize tmux panes correctly.
