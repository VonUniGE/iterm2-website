3.4.4beta1

Annoying things I'm sorry about
- You'll be asked to re-install the Python
  runtime. This fixes a problem where pip3 would
  sometimes fail. Instead of creating a symlink
  of ~/Library/ApplicationSupport we will now use
  ~/.config/iterm2/AppSupport.

New Features
- Tab titles now parse very basic HTML tags for
  bold, italic, and underline. Less-than and
  ampersand entites are also recognized.
- Margins are now adjustable in Prefs >
  Appearance > Panes.
- Add an option to save prefs to a custom folder
  automatically.

Improvements
- Improve performance of opening lots of tabs at
  once.
- Improve performance when changing prefs that
  affect many tabs.
- Tabs are now selected on mouse down rather than
  on mouse up.
- Hide tab close button on small tabs to prevent
  accidental closure.
- Confirm deleting entries in the password
  manager.
- Tab icons are now always left aligned and get
  replaced with the close button on hover.
- Plain-text logs now include timestamps.
- Recognize U+251C and U+2524 as column dividers
  for selection's soft boundaries.
- Reduce minimum dimming amount allowed in Prefs >
  Appearance > Dimming.
- Use terminal background color to determine
  appearance of composer.
- You can now use Cmd-W to dismiss the composer.
- Don't show an alert if the initial tmux
  integration command fails.
- When you split a pane in tmux integration and
  focus follows mouse is on, don't make the pane
  under the mouse active. Make the new pane
  active.
- New tmux windows created outside iTerm2 (e.g.,
  by running `tmux new-window`) will become tabs
  in the current window.
- Give backpressure to commands run in the
  background (e.g., from triggers) to keep them
  from hogging CPU.
- Improve performance of creating a new session in
  a custom directory.
- Improve performance when there are big
  background images.
- The composer now clears the existing command by
  sending C-U C-K.
- Handle "Default_Ignorable" unicode characters
  correctly.
- Use the background color of inactive sessions to
  determine the split pane divider color.
- Improve performance of decoding inline images.
- Make trackpads scroll faster to act more like
  other macOS apps.
