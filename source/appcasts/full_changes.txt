3.3.10

Security Improvements
- Improves the method for gaining authorization
  to run Python scripts launched from outside
  iTerm2.

  Version 3.3.9 deprecated the older auth
  mechanism based on the command line, requiring
  the user to consent to every connection. That
  was annoying.

  There are now two ways to get permission:

  1. The UI prompts on every connection.
  2. The app requests a cookie using Applescript.
     Therefore, Applescript permission is
     required. This requires the user to
     consent only once per app that originates the
     connection.

  Note that this does not affect scripts launched
  by iTerm2, such as those opened from the Scripts
  menu.

  For more information, including details on how
  to use osascript to get a cookie, please see:
