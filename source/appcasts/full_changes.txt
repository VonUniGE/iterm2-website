3.4.4

Annoying things I'm sorry about
- You'll be asked to re-install the Python
  runtime. This fixes a problem where pip3 would
  sometimes fail. Instead of creating a symlink
  of ~/Library/ApplicationSupport we will now use
  ~/.config/iterm2/AppSupport.

New Features
- Tab titles now parse very basic HTML tags for
  bold, italic, and underline. Less-than and
  ampersand entites are also recognized.
- Margins are now adjustable in Prefs >
  Appearance > Panes.
- Add an option to save prefs to a custom folder
  automatically.
- The composer now integrates with command history
  and makes completion suggestions.
- When you right click on text with a hyperlink,
  "Copy Link Address" is now available in the
  context menu.

Improvements
- The changelog now has a PGP signature.
- Improve performance of opening lots of tabs at
  once.
- Improve performance when changing prefs that
  affect many tabs.
- Tabs are now selected on mouse down rather than
  on mouse up.

  accidental closure.

  manager.

  replaced with the close button on hover.

- Don't show an alert if the initial tmux
  integration command fails.
- When you split a pane in tmux integration and
  focus follows mouse is on, don't make the pane
  under the mouse active. Make the new pane
  active.
- New tmux windows created outside iTerm2 (e.g.,
  by running `tmux new-window`) will become tabs
  in the current window.
- Give backpressure to commands run in the
  background (e.g., from triggers) to keep them
  from hogging CPU.
- Improve performance of creating a new session in
  a custom directory.
- Improve performance when there are big
  background images.
- The composer now clears the existing command by
  sending C-U C-K.

  correctly.

  determine the split pane divider color.
- Improve performance of decoding inline images.

  explainshell.com.
- When you hold down cmd while dragging in a file
  from Finder, insert a command to cd to its
  containing folder.

  every half second to prevent a brief hang after
  inactivity.

  indicated in the scroll bar.

  between tabs, like in Safari.

  "pause mode" that will automatically pause
  sessions in tmux integration that get very far
  behind with the ability to catch up quickly.
  NOTE: tmux 3.2 has not yet been released.
- tmux integration windows will now keep their
  size the same as you create or destroy split
  panes.
- Adds a preference to exclude iTerm2 from the
  dock and cmd-tab app switcher only if all

Improvements
- Various performance improvements.

  The security model has also changed: apps can
  authenticate via Applescript or you can choose
  to allow all programs running locally to use the
  API.
- Use a single daemon process for all sessions
  instead of one per session. This reduces the
  number of process IDs used and also improves the
  time to launch a new session.
- Background images are significantly faster when
  not using the GPU renderer.
- Most tables now allow multiple selection.
- The number of search results is now shown in the
  Find on Page UI.

  container format that signs the entire file
  except the signature itself.
- Improve cold launch time.
- Countless minor improvements and polishing.
- Big Sur supported.
- Permission is now requested before various
  possibly destructive or annoying activities are
  done in response to control sequences.
- Don't snap window size to the cell grid when it
  gets resized by an Accessibility API.

  originating from the built-in keyboard.
- The profile preference "Send text at start" is
  now an interpolated string.
- The profile preference "Custom command" is
  now an interpolated string.
- The feature where the scroll wheel sends arrow
  keys when in alternate screen mode now works
  even when alternate screen mode is disabled.
- Enable window shadow for transparent windows.
- When resizing the window while scrolled up in to
  history, keep the text in the top left locked in
  position.
- Show a brief message when automatic profile
  switching takes effect.
- Send a newline before sending the curl command
  to install shell integration to clear out any
  existing command.
- Disable GPU renderer for obscured windows when
  using the integrated GPU.
- When a tmux pane fails to split, don't detach.
- Remember tmux window sizes when reattaching.
- When disintering a buried tmux tab, put it back
  in the right position in the same window it came
  from.
- Draw outline on right hand side of last tab in
  minimal theme.

  Apple took it away from us :(
