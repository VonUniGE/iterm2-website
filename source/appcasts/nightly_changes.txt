2020-07-04: Fix big sur window border

2020-07-04: Disable window border feature on 10.16. I am
hopeful that it is no longer necessary now that I have fixed
the problem where window borders disappear for transparent
windows.

2020-07-04: Enable window shadow with blur on 10.16. Work
around a bug where blur would sometimes break when toggling
blur or use transparency.

2020-07-04: When transparent, don't set the background color
to clear. Instead, make it really close to clear. Apparently
this helps performance according to
https://notes.yvt.jp/Desktop-Apps/Enabling-Backdrop-Blur
because alpha of 0 is for irregularly shaped windows. I hold
hope that this means I can use the shadow again, too

2020-07-04: Use CGSDefaultConnectionForThread instead of
CGSMainConnectionID based on
https://notes.yvt.jp/Desktop-Apps/Enabling-Backdrop-Blur

2020-07-03: Remove bad test for whether mouse reporting
should start for a 3-finger drag. The removed code rested
whether mouse reporting was allowed in prefs, which is silly
because it's usually allowed in prefs but not usually
actually enabled. Furthemore, this code was unreachable when
the drag was reported because it returned early from the
function. Issue 8992

2020-07-03: Make minimal and compact windows draggable by
the area near the top (if top tabs) or bottom (if bottom
tabs) of the tabbar. Issue 8046

components. Issue 8517

and then call -[PseudoTerminal filter:]. The current
implementation uses the find pasteboard which is impossible
for users to comprehend. Issue 3039

2020-06-29: Try to unbreak the nightly build for big sur
users

2020-06-29: Make the tabbar opaque when the window's
background is clear.

2020-06-29: Switch to within-window blending for the tabbar
backing doesn't appear translucent. This reverts
6328686a8e989dd5a2ac7ba3fcd918020c623a84. I can't reproduce
the problem that commit's message describes

2020-06-29: Force the tab bar to be a visible titlebar
accessory while entering fullscreen, and then set its max
height to 0 if it should be collapsed. Issue 8981

2020-06-29: Promote pref to make LSUIElement require only
hotkey windows out of advanced prefs. Default it to off
instead of on. Issue 8980

2020-06-29: Fix shortcut input view pre-big sur. Apparently
the changes I made to the sheet it's in for the hotkey
window made its window never key.

when all windows are hotkey windows (#420)

Add advanced pref to disable LSUIElement when there are
non-hotkey windows.

Co-authored-by: George Nachman <gnachman+github@gmail.com>
2020-06-25: Don't save window state except for hotkey
windows when not using system window restoration. I should
eventually change the behavior for hotkey windows, too, but
that will be more involved because it'll break workflows.
Issue 8960.

2020-06-25: Add FUNDING.yml

2020-06-25: Fix false pause detections. Negative slope
predicted a pause in the past, which is not a useful
prediction, so ignore negative slopes. Also require five
consecutive redzone predictions before warning to deal with
momentary latency spikes.

big sur

2020-06-24: Improve appearance of regular tabs in big sur

2020-06-23: Refactor tmux response handling. Fix a bug where
if a command early in a list with a nil target got an error
then the rest of the list would not be canceled, causing a
hang.  Tolerate errors from refresh-client -C. Issue 8943.

2020-06-23: Fix logic for adjusting tmux layout. If the root
view is larger than the flexible view, you really have to
resize it or content will be outside the visible bounds. If
it's smaller by more than one cell, that should also be
fixable.

2020-06-21: Remove Travis. It's broken beyond repair.

2020-06-21: Fix a bug where ThreeFingerTapGestureRecognizer
incorrectly looked for >3 touches on the *previous* count of
touches rather than the current count. That allowed a
four-finger tap to be treated as a three finger tap, which
causes quicklook activations when swiping between desktops.
Issue 8955

2020-06-21: Stop using ruby in CI because both Ruby and
Travis are kinda broken. Travis fails while trying to
install libxml, which seems to be related to ruby. This
loses code coverage, but I didn't even know we had that...

2020-06-21: Switch a bunch of experimental features to
always on in preparation for 3.4

Issue 8959

2020-06-20: Move nontrivial screen parameters change check
into presentation controller. Fix coalescing. General clean
up

2020-06-20: Avoid disabling metal when the app is activated.
For some reason we get screenParametersChanged sometimes
upon activation which causes metal to be deactivated at the
worst possible time.

2020-06-19: Disable metal during split pane dragging for
tmux sessions. Issue 8954.

2020-06-18: Fix a bug where native fullscreen is broken on
10.15.5 because we set the style mask to not-fullscreen from
refreshTerminal when the window's effective appearance
changes just before didEnterFullScreen. Issue 8945

2020-06-18: Cancel mouse reporting frustration detection
when we get a control sequence to copy to the clipboard.
Issue 8905

2020-06-18: Update presentation controller after adding or
removing a window from iTermController instead of after
initializing a full screen window. It has no effect before
the window is added to the controller. Issue 8951

2020-06-18: Add support for tmux wait-exit. See
https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2246

2020-06-16: When tmux variable window sizes are in use, do
not automatically resize them. This is a little gross when
there are two clients connected and the other one does a
live resize. But other than that it's a much better
experience because the window size stays stable as you
create and destroy split panes.

2020-06-16: Fix rounding calculation for variableTmuxSize.

2020-06-16: Fix frame of metal view in tmux integration with
extra margin on the bottom

view not being updated in issue. 8843

to a screen, provided that frame is on the proper screen.
Issue 8944

2020-06-13: cmd-click on a file: url with a fragment now
open using semantic history. If it has a #line or #line:col
fragment, it opens to that line.

2020-06-13: Invalidate app restorable state after adding a
URL to the store

2020-06-13: Make the URL hover view prettier

2020-06-13: Invalidate app restorable state after adding an
image

2020-06-13: Change CSI u mode to send control-/ but to treat
control-? as backspace. Issue 8382

2020-06-13: Fix swipe when it enters a tmux integration
session. It was using root_ when it should have been using
flexibleView_, which is the parent of root_.

2020-06-13: Fix color of about box error message. Arcify
iTermAboutWindowController.m. Sort names lexicographically.

2020-06-13: When erasing the display after the cursor or the
line after the cursor and the cursor is in the first column
make the preceding line EOL_SOFT. Issue 8938.

2020-06-13: Make IntelliJ IDEA a first class citizen of
semantic history; it is now available as an editor

second to make the results more stable and use less cpu

2020-06-11: Fix bad cherrypick

2020-06-11: Fix a bug in how we calculate the tmux window
size for variable-size windows.

Previously, we calculated the desired tmux window size by
adding the smallest content size to the number of dividers.
That wasn't quite right, though. Sometimes you need to use
the *largest* content size instead, because that gets you a
smaller result. There was a tab like:

+-------+ |   |   | |   |   | |   +---| |   |   | |   |   |
+-------+

When the divider is thin and there's no per-pane title bar,
the window size is constrained by the tall pane because
tmux's divider is thicker than iTerm2's. The result is that
-variableTmuxSize returned a size that was a little too big.
That kicked off a vicious cycle:

1. Cause a layout change, such as by dragging a pane divider
or resizing the window. The layout size we request is too
big because of this bug.  2. Tmux sends %layout-change.  3.
TmuxWindowOpener updates the layout.  4. The flexible view
is smaller than the split view because the layout size that
came back was bigger than the window.  5. layoutIsTooLarge
return YES.  6. TmuxWindowOpener calls fitLayoutToWindows.
7. It resizes the window to its current size.  8. GOTO 2.

Issue was reported by ashturm via chat.

2020-06-10: Disable metal during tmux split drag. Fix
implementation of
sessionViewShouldUpdateSubviewsFramesAutomatically which got
negated at some point.

2020-06-10: Enable pause mode only after guessing tmux
version

2020-06-10: Fix build

pause mode. Still some changes coming, like
%extended-output. https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2217

2020-06-09: Fix a bug where the 'restore full screen
windows' prompt was given if there were no windows to
restore and canceling didn't reset the counter so it would
keep asking after a cancel.

2020-06-09: Fix a bug where restoring a tmux controller
didn't set the DCS unique ID so that when an invalid token
is received it wasn't able to break the parser out of the
DCS hook. Issue 8936

2020-06-09: Set echo probe duration to 0 to disable probing

2020-06-09: Update regex for http(s) URLs to ignore parens
just before and after URL. Regex by @joliss. Random entity
escaping by xcode. Issue 8925

2020-06-06: Make multiserver cd to root when starting up in
case it's launched in a network path that disappears

2020-06-03: Remove the pause mode announcement properly when
you press a key. Unpause when attaching if tmux 3.2+ since a
pane might get paused right away

2020-06-03: Add support for tmux pause mode. Still lots of
polish needed around the UI and testing. For all the gory
details see https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2217
