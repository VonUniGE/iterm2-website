2020-11-23: Cmd-w to dismiss composer. Issue 9291

2020-11-23: Use terminal background color to determine
appearance of composer. Issue 9291

2020-11-21: Fix signed/unsigned comparison that caused beta
assert. Issue 7446

2020-11-21: Add a profile setting to prevent control
sequences from enabling modifyOtherKeys

2020-11-20: Fix crashes in accessibility handlers going out
of bounds

2020-11-20: Change how we handle control keys in
modifyOtherKeys=2 mode. We want to always send a control
sequence for them, even if other modifiers besides control
are pressed. On some keyboards, you need to press
control+opt+something to get control+somethingelse; for
those, hide the opt and treat it like control+somethingelse.
See Elias's comments on Issue 9279

2020-11-19: Fix shortcut for composer in tip of the day

2020-11-19: Don't daemonize iTermServer.

It doesn't seem to be necessary. I tested logging out and
back in, fast user switching, and applescript. I was focused
on not regressing on issue 9000 (activity monitor shows
process not responding; that was because we connected to the
window server but didn't run an event loop) and issue 8986
(applescript doesn't work, I think also because of the
window server connection).

This should fix issue 9276 where BBEdit wants to look at the
parent process of the shell to find the cocoa app that owns
it.

The new behavior is similar to what the monoserver did, so I
can't think of why it wouldn't work. I look forward to being
surprised.

2020-11-19: Handle short writes correctly in
iTermFileDescriptorClientWrite

2020-11-19: Don't show short-lived session warning in tmux
integration when creating a new tmux session.

2020-11-19: Soft-close when detaching from tmux. This
prevents panes from getting killed when switching the active
session. Issue 9277.

2020-11-19: Lie and say that windows are movable during menu
item validation in a terminal window so that Window > Move
to [display] will be enabled. Issue 9278.

2020-11-19: Ensure no double callback when the server closes
the connection just before we send a launch request. The
read callback would detect the EOF and invoke completion
callbacks on pending requests and then remove all pending
launches. Then the send would fail, causing its completion
block to run the pending-launch callback. This ensures that
we only run the pending launch callback if the pending
launch still exists, and ensures we remove it before
invoking its callback. Also handle EAGAIN properly in
iTermFileDescriptorClientWrite and its callsites. Issue 9266

2020-11-18: Add debug logging for untitled window opening

2020-11-18: Add logging to untitled window state machine

2020-11-18: Don't set tmux client size to less than 2. Issue
9274

2020-11-18: Fix background color blending in GPU renderer.

It did not implement the two-layer model correctly. The
model is that there's a view with the default background
color that non-default colors are rendered over top of.

The main change is to perform this blending in the
background color renderer's vertex shader.

This commit also fixes a problem where we'd update the
iTermImageView's content for no reason when switching panes
which made it very slow.

Also fixes a bug where iTermImageView would become visible
when you twiddle the blending slider even though the GPU
renderer was on.

I discovered this because of issue 9245, although it's
probably not what the issue's creator was hoping for.

2020-11-18: Handle EAGAIN properly in
iTermFileDescriptorClientWrite and in its callsite. Issue
9161

2020-11-18: Fix scp in adhoc

2020-11-18: Fix scp host in adhoc.sh

2020-11-18: Don't use application keypad-style arrow keys
when application cursor mode is on.

Commit ac1aa575011028ed86851c15b177b0e9c78082e0 introduced
this behavior as part of implementing modifyOtherKeys=2
mode. The reason why was not recorded.

This breaks vim (issue 9273).

The current behavior now matches xterm. This is what xterm
does:

normal                                CSI D app cursor keys
SS3 D modifyOtherKeys=2                     CSI D
modifyOtherKeys=2 + app cursor keys   SS3 D

I also tested against emacs running in tmux, which came up
in issue 9161. In that issue, I wrongly state that "It looks
like either tmux or emacs doesn't want the SS3 arrows even
in application cursor mode". When I run emacs in tmux, it
does use app cursor mode and emacs handles the SS3 arrows
just fine.

2020-11-17: Reduce minimum dimming amount to 0.01. Issue
9270

2020-11-17: Fix support for $$$$. In profile commands it
should be replaced with $$. The replacement was done too
early. This triggered an unrelated issue where an
unterminated $$varname$$ caused a crash. Issue 9271

2020-11-17: Set the root terminal view's imageview's
transparency on 10.16. Delete some dead pre-Mojave code.
Fixes a bug where on Big Sur transparency doesn't work with
background images.

2020-11-17: Fix opaque top/bottom margins from issue 9257

2020-11-17: Update shell integration. At commit
b8fc99adca91fb2a783120c8981b0803a4859dbf in iterm2-website

2020-11-17: Handle EAGAIN in
iTermFileDescriptorMultiClient.tryWrite. Issue 9266

2020-11-17: Check if system python has an old installation
of the iterm2 module and help user upgrade it. Issue 9258

2020-11-17: Add u+251c and u+2524 (|- and -|) to column
dividers. Issue 9261

2020-11-17: Fix poor performance on window resize with
background image. Issue 9260

2020-11-17: Fix right click. Issue 9259

2020-11-17: Fix escaping of path in applescript command that
creates the noauthMagic file. Issue 9255

2020-11-17: Fix a bug where the window title was not shown
in the window titlebar when the tabbar was invisible. Issue
9253

2020-11-16: Add async_add_annotation to Python docs

2020-11-16: [python, api] Add Session.add_annotation(range,
text). Issue 8111

2020-11-16: Make margins adjustable in
prefs>appearance>panes, remove from advanced prefs.

2020-11-16: Add back git pushes to release_stable.sh

2020-11-16: Validate selectors for smart selection actions
in textview context menu. Issue 9249

2020-11-15: Log timestamps in plain-text logs

2020-11-15: Fix shifted underline in GPU renderer. The
cellOffset is pixels from the window's left edge. The
cellSize is typically smaller than the glyphSize. So it is
not safe to add cellSize to cellOffset without including the
extra padding added by the glyphSize. Issue 9242

2020-11-15: Add support for HTML in tab titles.

2020-11-14: Keep tab icons left aligned. When the tab close
button is shown, replace the icon with it. Issue 7990

2020-11-14: Let xcode have its merry way with project files

2020-11-14: Leave an empty area at the top for lion
fullscreen in big sur, because in that case the tabbar is a
titlebar accessory. Issue 9238

2020-11-14: Apply hack from preceding commit to runtime
downloader and migration helper

2020-11-14: Work around Big Sur bug where alerts don't
resize in a single call to layout. Issue 9240

2020-11-13: Work around an apparent bug in Big Sur where
NSURLSession downloads fail with 'the network connection was
lost' for no good reason. Try to resume up to 10 times. If
this catches fire it could be because a user is MITMed by
their employer with a proxy that doesn't handle resumes
correctly. Issue 9236.

2020-11-13: Confirm deletion from password manager

2020-11-13: Hide tab close button on inactive small tabs

2020-11-13: Turn on select tabs on mouse down by default.

2020-11-13: Reduce calls to PSMTabBarControl.update to
improve performance when changing settings that affect lots
of tabs (e.g., colors)

2020-11-13: Cache progress indicator frames for better
performance when creating lots of tabs. Defer calls to
PSMTabBarControl.update from progressIndicatorNeedsUpdate to
improve performance when creating/removing lots of tabs

2020-11-13: Improve performance of opening lots of tabs at
the same time by deferring calls to PTYTab.setObjectCount,
which is surprisingly slow. Also fix animations for tab
progress indicators when moving the tab to another position
in the window

2020-11-13: Check for bogus count before updating DB

2020-11-13: 3.4.0

2020-11-12: Enable new tmux window/tab menu items when no
window is key but there is exactly one tmux connection. This
makes it easier to open a tmux window on a Space with no
iterm2 windows. Issue 9227.

2020-11-12: Increase max blur on 10.15+. Issue 9229

2020-11-12: Respect CSI u for arrow keys. See mailing list
thread 'The key <F4> cannot be used for key binding in vim'
(which prompted the change due to vim using CSI u mode,
which was itself a bad idea) and then see issue 9228

2020-11-12: Bump min version of python API to 70 to make
everyone on a version that was only used by betas of 3.4
upgrade to the same version as people running non-beta
versions

2020-11-12: Fix release-iTerm2.plist which used
SUPublicDSAKeyFile instead of SUPublicEDKey as the key for
the EdDSA key

2020-11-12: 3.4.0

2020-11-12: Fix width of edit session preference panel on
big sur. It was too wide because it used the width of the
regular prefs panel

2020-11-12: Change release_stable to update final_new.xml

2020-11-12: Add composer image

2020-11-11: Add onboarding images

2020-11-09: Bump Python API version to 1.17

2020-11-09: Update menu IDs

2020-11-08: Update whats new window for 3.4

2020-11-05: Fix (hopefully!) a bug where sendmsg failed with
EMSGSIZE despite the message not exceeding IOV_MAX. When it
fails in this way you end up with a daemon that can't be
attached to.

2020-11-04: Set client size when initializing tmux
connection so that when opening tabs in the same window as
the gateway, the window will not resize. I can't tell why I
made doing refresh-client -C conditional on not having
variable-size windows. I tested attaching to tmux with
restoring tmux tabs in  a new window and as tabs in the
gateway window and this works better in both configurations.
Issue 9196

2020-11-04: Change how perceptual distance is calculated for
new trigger colors to use only lightness. The dumb old Delta
E formula doesn't seem very good for comparing pairs of dark
colors.

2020-11-01: Remove name field from add trigger dialog
because it is not used. Fix a crash when adding a trigger to
a profile with none

2020-11-01: Fix square corners bug

2020-10-31: Add 'add trigger' to context menu.

Adds a new view controller for editing the trigger.  Adds
colorspace conversion code for picking a trigger color.

2020-10-30: Fix support for multiple broadcast domains per
window in Python API. Clean up broadcast helper to track
domains and generally be less hacky. For example, it didn't
used to remember BROADCAST_TO_ALL_PANES and would switch
itself to OFF. Now it behaves as you would expect. Issue
9222

2020-10-29: Create a new logging helper when starting a
program. Fixes a bug where restarting a terminated session
creates a log file but never appends to it. Issue 9218

2020-10-29: Simplify getting the local hostname. Turns out
gethostbyname gives a fqdn on bsd. We therefore can do a
fresh lookup on every use and not break the git status bar
component when the hostname changes. Issue 9217

2020-10-28: Reinstate borders on big sur. Dark background
windows need it in the light theme because they have a
barely visible border drawn by the OS.

2020-10-27: Add VS15 to default-text-presentation emoji that
follow a default-emoji-presentation emoji in the legacy
renderer. macOS cleverly upgrades them to emoji presentation
(with some exceptions). It is a pita for the GPU renderer to
do that, so instead of giving it the magical power of
letting adjacent characters affect each other's appearance
and making it slower and even more complex, instead prevent
the legacy renderer from 'enjoying' this 'feature'. Issue
9185

2020-10-27: Add the ability to output emoji presentation
charsets to emoji.py

2020-10-26: Add square window corner images

2020-10-26: Add support for square window corners. Issue
9211

2020-10-25: Reset send modifiers when restoring a session
and not attaching to a process. Fixes a bug where restoring
windows could leave you at a shell prompt with
modifyOtherKeys=2, which is awful

2020-10-25: Send CSI for shift-tab in modifyOtherKeys=2 to
unbreak vim

2020-10-25: Add script to help rename iconsets
appropriately. Use in conjunction with Image2Icon

2020-10-25: Make a sketch file with the icon and the thicker
bezel used in later big sur betas. Issue 8969.

2020-10-25: Disable subpixel antialiasing on big suf. Issue
9209

2020-10-25: Only respect application keypad/application
cursor mode for unmodified keypresses. See analysis in issue
9161

2020-10-24: Don't keep a separate date formatter for each
script history entry. They are quite expensive. Issue 7189

2020-10-24: Use double/cgfloat everywhere for vertical and
horizontal  spacing. Because we compute line height/char
width using ceil, using float for some calculations can
result in a 1pt error. When using Menlo Regular 25pt with
80% hspacing and 80% vspacing, tmux tabs compute a height
that is wrong because .8 is different enough between float
and double that it computes 24 instead of 25 for the width
(and likewise is off by 1 for height). Hopefully this fixes
issue 9195

2020-10-24: Fix shift-return in profiles window. It now gets
handled by the tableview so the shortcut doesn't get called.
I'm going to leave the shortcut handlers because I can't be
sure I handled every possible way the keystroke could get
routed. Issue 9205

2020-10-22: Add a crlf after a sixel image, like xterm.
Issue 9204

2020-10-22: Draw outline on right side of single-tab minimal
tab. Issue 9201

2020-10-22: Make windows movable after exiting lion full
screen. Issue 9198

2020-10-15: Make iTermOrderedDictionary ignore duplicate
keys. Fixes an assertion in issue 9179 caused by a bum db
with two of the same key from a previous buggy version. The
issue was in the before-dict which is why my previous
attempt to fix this didn't work.

2020-10-15: Hex dump malformed message in multiserver for
issue 9022

2020-10-14: Remove inexplicable minus ones that were added
by 784c183bd6bbf6b21df0411f9015aee8cffb83a8. They caused the
bottom margin to be too big when resizing a tmux window
quickly vertically. They also caused a tmux window to shrink
when adjusting its height with window > resize > increase
height.

2020-10-14: Remove titlebar accessory tabbar after exiting
lion fullscreen, otherwise a single-tab tabbar remains
visible when it shouldn't be. This is especially bad with
tmux tabs, where it assumes it gets the full tabview height
and therefore runs off the bottom.

2020-10-14: Update layouts when scroller style changes.
Issue 7481

2020-10-11: Make 'new tab using same profile' have correct
overriddenFields so that it can later be saved into an
arrangement correctly. Issue 9187

2020-10-11: When you disinter a tmux tab, remember its
window and index, even across detach-attach. Issue 9186

2020-10-10: Ensure no duplicate items in graph db arrays
when saving. The user had a duplicate tab ID. This could
have been a carryover from before the bug where duplicating
a tab would duplicate its tab ID was fixed. Issue 9179.

2020-10-10: Add debug logging for bury/disinter session for
issue 9186

2020-10-08: Add support for VS-16 changing the width of the
base character but don't enable it.

Turning this on breaks vim because it doesn't handle VS-16,
and then draws over the right-hand cell, erasing the
character. See issue 9185

2020-10-07: Translate fractional timestamps to local date in
context menu. Inspired by PR 429

2020-10-07: Assert that array identifiers in the graph
encoder are unique

2020-10-07: Remember tmux window size when using
variable-size windows

2020-10-07: Remove NSLogs

2020-10-07: Fix swap left/right/above/below for tmux. Issue
9177

2020-10-07: Tolerate failure to split pane in tmux. Issue
9083

2020-10-07: Fix a bug where the wrong background color was
used for the flexible view when it was slightly larger than
the root view. Issue 9083 (in a comment)

2020-10-06: Revert unintentional change from
6b4cbcd17f47c1a7591f0e1873830c372ca6d99e that broke trimming
whitespace and trailing newlines when copying to clipboard.
Issue 9182

2020-10-04: Disable metal for obscured windows when using
integrated GPUs. Issue 9174

2020-10-04: Add copy with control sequences

2020-10-04: Add an advanced pref to show tab title in the
window titlebar when there is no tabbar

2020-10-04: Add support for decoding microsecond timestamps.
Issue 9175.

2020-10-04: Move tmux dashboard initilaization into
windowDidLoad to prevent spurious opening as seen in 9168.
Also change the xib to not make it visible at launch. I'm
not sure why it only happened for this user, though.

2020-10-03: Update bash shell integration (for issue 9171)
and utilities

2020-10-03: Don't remove auto-hide dock and auto-hide menu
bar from the app presentation options when it also has the
full screen presentation option or else the title bar and
its titleBarViewController disappears.

Issue 9164

2020-10-02: Fix prefs window shrinking width when on text
pane and changing profiles

2020-10-02: Add support for changing the xterm verison
number. Add support for modifyOtherKeys mode 1 to try to fix
emacs. It won't work until you bump the xterm version to at
least 216 but I'm afraid to do that because who knows what
will break. Issue 9161.
