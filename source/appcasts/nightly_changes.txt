2021-04-30: Treat 'move to [display]' menu item key actions
specially. Don't depend on them being in the window menu
since this is contingent on which screen the key window is
on. Instead, manually add them and invoke them specially.
Store a unique identifier for the display with the binding.
Do a bunch of annoying stuff to give screens unique names
like what's in the Window menu. Issue 9666.

large) when the next instance in the row is not underlined.
Issue 9653

standard cmd-ctrl-F. If you have a profile whose shortcut is

2021-04-20: In big sur when the tabbar is on top in native
fullscreen make the tabbar a titlebar accessory view
controller only if it is no normally shown. When it *is*
normally shown, we move it out of the titlebar so that it
doesn't get a shadow under it. Issue 9639. This also removes
some AFAICT dead code for disabling titlebar accessory VCs
in big sur (it was off by default)
