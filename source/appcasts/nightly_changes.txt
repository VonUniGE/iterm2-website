2021-06-05: Convert click coordinates to the adjusted
document visible rect before using them. This fixes a bug
where scrolling while there is new input coming + scrollback
overflow causes the selection to jump around. That's because
the click location is given to us by the OS based on where
the scrollview is scrolled to, but that doesn't exactly
correspond to what the user sees since we account for
scrollback overflow when drawing to keep the screen stable
when userScroll is on.

2021-06-05: When copying the server binary over, remove the
old one first.

2021-06-05: Fix a bug where the content jumps around when
scrolled up and there's scrollback overflow. Issue 9755

them to the preceding cell. This prevents a ligature from
forming at drawing time. Issue 9699

2021-05-15: Remove prompt marks when doing ED 0 (erase in
display below cursor). Fixes a bug where marks get left
behind in tmux integration with shell integration enabled
because the screen terminal uses ED 0 instead of ED 2 to
clear the screen.

2021-05-15: Draw the adjusted document-visible rect. The
adjusted rect is forced to the bottom when userScroll is
off, even if the scrollview isn't caught up yet. This
prevents artifacts for example in (non-integration) tmux
when saving lines to scrollback in alternate screen mode for
